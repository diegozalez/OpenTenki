# OpenTenki PCB

The board uses Esp32-s3-mini N4R2 as the microcontroler, this is because the small form factor, compatibility with Tasmota and ESPhome and wifi capabilitys.
For the sensors they are conected with i2c. 
  ### Bosch BME688 
  This is use to monitor the air quality as well as presure, temperature and humidity 
  ### VEML 7700 
  With this sensor you can monitor Ambient ligth, Infrared and full spectrum ligth, is a cheap a reliable option 
  ### HDH3022
  This last sensor can measure temperature and humidity much more precise than the BME688 and is way cheaper so if you dont need the air quality or the atmosferic presure its a great way, is also usefull for more precise measuremnts
